# GTD Tasks

An [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) plugin that organizes your markdown tasks using the **Getting Things Done** methodology. Tasks are grouped into time-horizon buckets (Today, This Week, Someday…) in a sidebar panel, with one-click moves between buckets.

## Usage

### Open the panel

Click the checklist icon in the left ribbon, or run **Open GTD Panel** from the Command Palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + P`).

### Complete a task

Click the checkbox on any task row. A celebration animation plays (if enabled), and the task fades out.

### Move a task

Three ways to move a task to a different bucket:

| Method | How |
|---|---|
| **Quick-move buttons** | Click the small bucket buttons on the right side of the task row |
| **Drag-and-drop** | Drag a task row to any bucket, including collapsed ones |
| **Context menu** | Right-click a task row → **Move to…** |

The plugin writes the assignment back to the source markdown file immediately.

---

## Configuration

Open **Settings → GTD Tasks** to configure the plugin.

### Storage mode

Controls how bucket assignments are stored on the task line:

| Mode | Example |
|---|---|
| **Inline tag** (default) | `- [ ] Buy milk #gtd/today` |
| **Inline field** | `- [ ] Buy milk [gtd:: today]` |

You can migrate all existing assignments between modes from the settings tab.

### Tag prefix

The prefix used in both storage modes. Default: `gtd`. Changing this also changes the tag/field name written to your files.

### Task scope

Limit which files are indexed:

- **Entire vault** — all `*.md` files
- **Specific folders** — enter one or more folder paths
- **Specific files** — enter one or more file paths

### Tasks plugin integration

When enabled, the plugin reads `📅 YYYY-MM-DD` due dates written by the [Tasks](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks) community plugin and automatically assigns tasks to the matching time-horizon bucket. Manual assignments (tag/field) always take priority over date-based ones.

### Celebration animations

Choose what plays when you check off a task:

| Setting | Effect |
|---|---|
| **All** (default) | Confetti burst + pixel creature |
| **Confetti** | Confetti burst only |
| **Creature** | Pixel creature only |
| **Off** | No animation |

### Stale indicator

When enabled, a `!` badge appears on tasks whose due date has passed the end of their assigned bucket's scheduled window — a reminder to reschedule or complete them.

### Status bar

Each bucket can optionally show its task count in Obsidian's status bar. Toggle per bucket in the bucket list at the bottom of settings.

### Compact view

Reduces padding on bucket headers and task rows for a denser layout.

## Bucket Date Rules

Each bucket can have an optional date range rule that auto-assigns tasks based on their `📅` due date:

| Rule | Covers |
|---|---|
| `today` | Today only |
| `this-week` | Tomorrow through end of this week (Sunday) |
| `next-week` | Next Monday through the following Sunday |
| `this-month` | Remaining days through end of this calendar month |
| `next-month` | First through last day of next calendar month |
| `within-days` | Due within the next N days |
| `within-days-range` | Due between day M and day N from today |
| `beyond-days` | Due more than N days from today (useful for Someday) |

Tasks with no due date and no manual assignment land in **To Review**.

## To Review Bucket

The To Review bucket is a permanent system bucket that always appears first in the panel. It collects every task that has no manual assignment and no matching due date rule. Use it as a GTD-style inbox: process tasks from here by moving them into the appropriate time-horizon bucket.
